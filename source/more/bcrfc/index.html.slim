        | In April 1998, on a dark and stormy night in the back of the
          smokiest pub in Brussels, five pillars of the local Irish
          ex-pat community got together over a few drinks, and, in
          what can only be described as a rare moment of clarity, put
          pen to paper to form a new rugby club. This new club would
          be open to ex-pats from the world over as well as all
          Belgians, be they Flemish or Walloon! It would be open to
          all players and levels of experience. And what a ride it’s
          been since then!

      p

        | The club has experienced the highs of promotion up to
          Division II, including a perfect league season with 18 wins
          out of 18 matches, one near-perfect season with a single
          league loss, victory in two national knock-out competitions,
          qualifying for the play-offs in our very first year in
          Division II and winning the Plate in a 7s tournament. Alas,
          then came the troubled years, with the departure of key
          players, field issues and the lows of relegation.

      p

        | But those obstacles were duly swept aside! The club secured
          a fantastic pitch at the VUB in 2008, and has been growing
          in strength ever since.

      p

        | In 2005 a Touch rugby team was added to the club. While
          Touch maybe considered a summer sport in many countries,
          here in Brussels we play all year round. Touch grew rapidly
          from a small group of dedicated people that trained on the
          same pitch as the men’s rugby team to a large and important
          part of the club to include female members (fondly
          considered The Great Leap Forward!)

      p

        | In 2006 we started a Rugby School with an eye firmly on the
          club’s future. We already have Under-17s, U-15s, U-13s,
          U-11s & U-9s age groups that train every week and take part
          in regular league matches and tournaments. In less than five
          seasons the school has gone from non-existent to having over
          100 active members of every nationality.
