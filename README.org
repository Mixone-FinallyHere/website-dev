#+TITLE: BBRFC Celtic Website Documentation
#+AUTHOR: Carlos Requena

* Goal of the project

To create a no-bullshit-attractive-static-HTML-website and give the
impression there is some "dynamic" content in it. Cleanliness and
clarity are important.

* What tools does it use?

** Content generation and template system, building the website

   [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) (a Ruby static site
   generator) using [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) as a template
   engine.

   There are some helpers defined in ~config.rb~ like ~nav_link~,
   ~file_link~, ~create_heading~ and ~page_title~ that help when
   writing the markup.

   Others are provided by the [Padrino
   framework](http://www.padrinorb.com/).

*** Deployment

   The website can be deployed either by running ~rake
   deploy_droplet~, if an own server is configured beforehand or
   ~middleman deploy~, to deploy to GitHub pages, using the
   ~middleman-deploy~ gem.

   When using the middleman method, the ~/build~ directory is pushed
   to another repo, that is 'GitHub Pages enabled'.

   More information can be found in the Rakefile or config.rb respectively.


** Dependency manager

   RubyGems are all provided in the Gemfile to use with Bundler.

   [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) is used to
   manage JS assets mainly. It concatenates and uglifies all the
   necessary files. The latter are 'imported' with ~//= require~

   Rakefile to execute simple tasks is available too.

** Stylesheets

   Sass files are automatically generated, the main Sass file is
   located at: ~assets/css/style.sass~, and it uses partials (with
   ~@import~, not Sprockets!) from the same folder and other gems (like
   bootstrap). Compiles to ~assets/css/style.css~, which is
   compressed.

   Another stylesheet - ~assets/css/delayed.sass~ - is loaded after
   the document is ready, to reduce the amount of unnecessary data for
   the above-the-fold content

*** Responsiveness

    Bootstrap framework (v3.3.5) - http://getbootstrap.com. CSS (grid,
    panel, forms, nav, navbar...) and JS (scrollspy.js, affix.js).

***  Sponsors images = spriting with Compass

     All sponsor images are put in a folder which is then passed to
     Compass to generate the sprite PNG and the necessary CSS. This
     process is automatic and makes it very simple to just add or
     remove sponsors when needed.

     The images are then put in a kind of 'masonry' layout, which does
     not look too bad.

** Documentation

   OPTIONAL: Emacs Org mode - to generate docs
   (~README.md~). Otherwise just edit markdown.

* Previewing, simple install

  First two things are bundler and rake. Install all dependencies with
  ~bundle install~.

  Then run:

  ~rake preview~ or ~middleman server~.

  The site should be available at:

  ~localhost:4567/~

* "/Dynamic content/"

  Files in the partials folder mainly. Generated with PHP scripts
  (using Facebook Graph API) elsewhere and pushed with a Machine User
  every X minutes using cron.

  It will generate:

  1. A number of ~<img>~ tags (10) with random pictures, to use with a
     gallery in the landing page.
  2. A JSON object containing all Facebook events, stored in a
     variable in a ~.js~ file (for simplicity and so Sprockets can
     require it)
  3. Updated league tables with scores, to include in the different
     sections.

  Events that Fullcalendar shows that are not on Facebook are updated
  on the fly with Ajax.

  A Facebook page plugin is also used in the landing page. This is a
  simplified version of the original one, which was built from scratch
  using the Facebook Graph API, and is more convenient. This one, and
  the fotorama gallery are loaded only when the user scrolls past a
  certain point, to avoid having to load it at the beginning.

* Other "patches"

  Contact forms supported by Formspree - although a good idea - are
  dropped for the moment due to the lack of a clear Privacy Policy. A
  contact list is provided instead.

* Known issues



* Possible problems

Automatically pushing "dynamic content" with the Machine User could
break the page or have unintended results.

* Improvements

  - Include PHP scripts in this repo or submodule.

  - Using the Google Maps API, create a nice map showing where all
    members come from, extracting info using the Facebook Graph
    API. Then link it to string: "most international rugby club".

  - Make use of the blogging feature to make the website feel even
    more 'alive' (who is going to be in charge of writing
    posts/news/updates?)

  - Make use of Middleman's i18n feature and translate the content to
    Dutch and French.

  - Related to above: user ~data~ folder more. Read middleman docs on
    it.
