        | During the regular season, September through May, trainings
          are held on Tuesdays from 18:30 to 20:30, and Wednesday and
          Friday evenings from 19:45 to 22:00 at the rugby pitch at
          the VUB, found in front of the tram stop
          <strong>VUB</strong>. We train either Tuesday or Wednesday,
          not both and we switch every two weeks, so check the
          calendar to be certain of when we are training. Note that
          this is an artificial grass pitch, and metal studs are not
          allowed (plastic studs are OK).

      p

        | We play matches on most Sundays, and in addition to our
          season-long competitions, we also organize friendly matches
          with both Belgian and touring teams from the UK,
          Netherlands, France, Spain and beyond.

      p

        | During the summer we also occasionally play 7s and may have
          random rugby training sessions in various spots. Many
          players also train and play with the Touch team as well
          during the off season. Please note that the only breaks in
          training are for major and national holidays.

        | In the season <strong>2016/2017</strong> BBRFC-Celtic 
          Mens XV teams will take part in two different 
          competitions. The first team will play in the third 
          division of the national league, D3 for short, with 
          a reserve team in the reserve competition of that 
          same league. The third team will play in what is 
          called the Rugby Vlaanderen regional championship, 
          which is the rugby regional championship of Flanders. 
      
      p
      
        ' This has changed from the season <strong>2015/2016</strong>
          due to adjustments in how the league works. Previously 
          there was no reserves competition in the D3 and therefore 
          BBRFC-Celtic Mens XV teams participated in three separate 
          competitions. More information on those changes can be found in
