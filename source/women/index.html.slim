        | Founded in 1995, the BBRFC-Celtic Women have been a consistent
          presence in Belgian Womenâ€™s Rugby. Highlights throughout
          their history include winning the Triple Crown in
          2005-2006 and becoming the Belgian Champions.

        | We are proud to call ourselves a through-and-through
          international team that today's team includes over a dozen
          nationalities. We are open to players from all backgrounds
          and levels of experience, and offer an excellent networking
          opportunity (read social side). Club socials, pubcrawls,
          BBQ's... lift the team spirit and give members a great
          opportunity to socialise and network with people from all
          over the world.
