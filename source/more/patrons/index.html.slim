              | Freddy learnt to play rugby with BBRFC during the late
                70's & early 80's as a prop and took part in the 1982
                Vancouver Tour. He is currently Honorary Mayor of Brussels
                and Honorary President of Brussels Expo (in charge of
                International Relations). He is a Belgian socialist

                to 2013 and previously also for a period in 1994.

            p

              | Born in Laeken in 1944, Freddy lived there during all his
                childhood. From this, he developed deep ties to the
                Brussels region and its way of life, a feeling of
                belonging to a tradition flows in his veins: fan of the
                Brussels dialect the Marollese (from the Marolles quarter)
                which he spoke with his grandfather, having learnt its
                diversity and culture mix through his mother, who was born
                in the "Klein Brabant".

            p

              | Freddy graduated in Commercial Sciences before working as
                a teacher at various high schools in Brussels. His
                political career started in 1983 when he worked on the
                cabinet of Herv√© Brouhon, then the mayor of
                Brussels. Freddy became an alderman for the Parti
                Socialiste in 1988, and mayor of Brussels between 1994 and
                1995. He served in the Brussels Parliament from 1995 until
                1999, when he became a member of the European
                Parliament. After the municipal elections of 2000 Freddy
                again became mayor of Brussels from early 2001; he
                resigned in 2013 due to his age, and has been succeeded by
                Yvan Mayeur.

            p

              | Freddy is a member of BBRFC Celtic and in September 2014
                was elected to the Board of the Belgian Rugby Union (FBRB)
                and appointed as a Vice President.
